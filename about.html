Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd. 
has been set up by the Ministry of Railways with the basic <br><br>
purpose of hiving off entire catering and tourism activity 
of the railways to the new Corporation so as to professionalise<br> <br>
and upgrade these services with public-private participation. Rail 
based Tourism in India will be the specific vehicle for achieving high<br> <br>
growth in coordination with state agencies, tour operators, travel agents 
and the hospitality industry. A dynamic marketing strategy in association <br><br>
with public and private agencies, tour operators, transporters, hoteliers 
and local tour promoters is on the anvil. Indian Railways span global<br><br> volumes
in hospitality and catering sectors with services provided to 13 million passengers everyday.</h2></center>
